### Some of the operations supported:

1. Register as a system administrator: 
   - Get user by id: http://localhost:5000/users/<int:uid>
   - Get admins http://localhost:5000/users/categories/admin
   - Get users http://localhost:5000/users/categories/user
  
2. Register as a person in need of resources: 
	 - Get user: http://localhost:5000/users/<int:uid>
	 - Get user http://localhost:5000/users/categories/<string:category>
  
3. Register as a person that supplies resources:

4. Add a request for a given resource:

5. Announce the availability of a resource: 
   - http://127.0.0.1:5000/resources/available/ 

6. Reserve or purchase a resource. Free resources are reserved. Otherwise, they are purchased 
These are PUT routes
   - Reserve a resource http://127.0.0.1:5000/resources/reserve/<int:rid>/ 
   - Purchase a resource http://127.0.0.1:5000/resources/purchase/<int:rid>/
  
Both these routes must include the form data of the transaction:

|tdate|2021-02-15|Year-month-day|
|tquantity|10|Number of items |
|tpayerpid|2|Payer (user) id |

7. Browse resources being requested - GET of all resources contained on a specific request (based on request id)
   - Get requests by resource:  http://127.0.0.1:5000/requests/resources/<int:rid>/
